He taught me everything about real estate, advertising and what it took to have a successful business. I worked there until I was 18 years old. From there I became a paralegal. Started working for a major law firm NYC. Then worked for law firms in NJ specializing in Real Estate and family law until I was 25 years old. I then worked about a year and half selling cars. I had started studying consistently natural medicine at the age of 10 years old. At 27 years old I was blessed to meet this wonderful woman who was a Ayurvedic physcian/surgeon. She was teaching a ayurvedic class that I attend. She saw something special in me and graciously offered a one on one internship with her that lasted for 5 years. During this time, after leaving sales, I had opened a Natural Medicine practice. Here I offered spiritual coaching, nutritional coaching and massage therapy. Through this business not only was I blessed to heal so many but through this process I gained so much more knowledge. I am now ready and excited for my journey into the software engineering experience. </p> </div> </body><div> <a href=\"/eacf331f0ffc35d4b482f1d15a887d3b.html\"><button class=\"businee\">HOME</button></a> <a href=\"/3b3b7c198828df7d02afa2d0c4978d14.html\"><button class=\"about\">ABOUT ME</button></a> <a href=\"/5e76c41e4194c17f45485eb77d61a16b.html\"><button class=\"businee\">BUSINESS EXPERIENCE</button></a> <button class=\"projects\">PROJECTS</button> <button class=\"contact\">CONTACT INFO</button> </div></html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"fb54fe4634e7fa75737be47d2289533d","cacheData":{}}
