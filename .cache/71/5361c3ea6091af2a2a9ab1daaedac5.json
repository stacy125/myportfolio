He taught me everything about real estate, advertising and what it took to\n            have a successful business. I worked there until I was 18 years old. From there I became a paralegal.\n            Started working for a major law firm NYC. Then worked for law firms in NJ specializing in Real Estate and\n            family law until I was 25 years old. I then worked about a year and half selling cars. I had started\n            studying consistently natural medicine at the age of 10 years old. At 27 years old I was blessed to meet\n            this wonderful woman who was a Ayurvedic\n            physcian/surgeon. She was teaching a ayurvedic class that I attend. She saw something special in me and\n            graciously offered a one on one internship with her that lasted for 5 years. During this time, after leaving\n            sales, I had opened a Natural Medicine practice. Here I offered spiritual coaching, nutritional coaching and\n            massage therapy. Through this business not only was I blessed to heal so many but through this process I\n            gained so much more knowledge. I am now ready and excited for my journey into the software engineering\n            experience. </p>\n    </body>\n    <div>\n        <a href=\"/eacf331f0ffc35d4b482f1d15a887d3b.html\"><button class=\"businee\">Home</button></a>\n        <a href=\"/3b3b7c198828df7d02afa2d0c4978d14.html\"><button class=\"about\">ABOUT ME</button></a>\n        <a href=\"/5e76c41e4194c17f45485eb77d61a16b.html\"><button class=\"businee\">BUSINESS EXPERIENCE</button></a>\n        <button class=\"projects\">PROJECTS</button>\n        <button class=\"contact\">CONTACT INFO</button>\n    </div>\n\n</html>\n"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"e07e66139dad03687057928e2aa40e27","cacheData":{}}
